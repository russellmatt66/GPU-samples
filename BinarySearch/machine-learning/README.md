# Overview
For large N, and Nx, i.e., problems approaching the limits of the GTX 960's capabilities, the CUDA-based timer began to malfunction, producing nonsense. Consequentially, to get a sense of the performance of the code in these regimes, machine learning (ML) models based on the Python scikit-learn (sklearn) library are built, and trained on the valid data.
